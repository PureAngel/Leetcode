Since the array is already sorted, 
we can keep two pointers ii and jj, 
where ii is the slow-runner while jj is the fast-runner. 
As long as nums[i] = nums[j]nums[i]=nums[j], 
we increment jj to skip the duplicate.

When we encounter nums[j] \neq nums[i]nums[j]¡Ùnums[i], 
the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to nums[i + 1]nums[i+1]. 
ii is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until jj reaches the end of array.
