O(log_5(N)) (base 5!) is faster than any polynomial. 
You need no more than 14 iterations to get the result. 
You just need to count how many times 5 appears in n! during multiplication in different forms: 
5, 25, 125, 625, ... . 
when any 5 is multiplied by 2 (we have many of them) then we get 0 at the end. 
That's it.
