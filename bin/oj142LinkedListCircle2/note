注意：circle不一定是从head开始的哦

两个pointer，一个快一个慢，2倍pace关系

Define two pointers slow and fast. Both start at head node, 
fast is twice as fast as slow. 
If it reaches the end it means there is no cycle, 
otherwise eventually it will eventually catch up to slow pointer somewhere in the cycle.

Let the distance from the first node to the the node where cycle begins be A, 
and let say the slow pointer travels travels A+B. 
The fast pointer must travel 2A+2B to catch up. 
The cycle size is N. 
Full cycle is also how much more fast pointer has traveled than slow pointer at meeting point.

A+B+N = 2A+2B
N=A+B
